			I have been a music writer and radio DJ since 2011, and I want to improve my computer fluency to better curate and present content in more engaging ways.  
			</p>

			<p class="text">
			I studied Journalism, Gender Studies, and Philosphy at Rutgers in New Brunswick, NJ.  While there I DJ'ed and managed their community radio station <a class="link" href="http://thecore.fm/public/index.php">90.3 The Core</a> and wrote for <a class="link" href="http://www.dailytargum.com/staff/josh-kelly">The Daily Targum</a> as well as our station's blog.  I went on to contribute writing to a (now-defunct) blog called Dingus On Music, and worked for several years as a clerk at <a class="link" href="https://vvinyl.com/shop/">Vintage Vinyl</a>.
